## Why LeetCode T-Shirts Cost 7200 Coins — A Simple Thought

I was casually browsing the LeetCode store and saw that the T-shirt now costs 7200 coins. It made me wonder — how do they even decide on that number?

Here’s a simple thought:

Maybe they look at it from the supply side — something like,  
> “We can afford to ship 8–10 T-shirts per week worldwide.”

If that's the case, they’d want to set a coin price so that only a very small percentage of users can realistically earn enough to claim it. That way, it stays sustainable.

And it makes sense. These coin-based rewards aren’t just giveaways. They:
- Encourage long-term consistency (daily problems, contests)
- Keep the rewards feeling valuable (scarcity)
- Drive platform engagement without actual cash rewards

It’s kind of like a low-key gamified system — not too flashy, but effective.  
Nothing too deep here, just a thought that stuck around.
